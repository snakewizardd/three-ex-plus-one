# The purpose of this repo

Let's try to learn more about the distribution of the 3x + 1 problem

## Key areas of interest

1. Methods 
    - using matrix operations

2. Trends
    - What trends do we see as we converge to 1?

## Simple experiment

Let's take a 100 * 100 matrix

this yields a matrix of 10k observations, which are all random integers until 1 billion

we will run the rule on each of these observations, then produce an output

the output will contain the full dataset

we will analyze the top 15 most recurring # of iterations to reach singularity

we are noticing patterns to this effect

we will publish the results of 100 loops of the 10k observations
